We''ll also post a few to our Alba Salix and Other Bothers podcast feeds, but Patreon patrons get to hear them all and hear them first! We are kicking things off with a recording from this past weekend in which the cast of The End of Time and Other Bothers sat down to play Larceny from Waning Gibbous Games. Larceny is a card game in the style of Apples To Apples or Cards Against Humanity, but one that lends itself very well indeed to improv and roleplaying. It''s themed around a heist, with the goal of stealing anything from diamonds to dinosaur DNA. With a pitch like that, how could we resist?

Between his rambling pronouncements that everyone is to blame for his position in life but himself, his implications that he is waiting for death, his willingness to endanger his family, and his legitimately deranged answers to a word-association game, this glimpse into Alex''s mental state walks a razor''s edge between hilarious and profoundly sad.','3');

On the very expected side, Alex gets super bigoted, then spends a disproportionate amount of his show talking about how he should be more cocky about how good his body is.

Unfortunately, the day that they end up covering involves Alex reporting on the murder of over 50 Palestinians by Israeli soldiers by mostly just talking about Muslims being bad.

Depending on who you ask, Mark Richards either is a crazy person who orchestrated a murder in 1984, or he is a Secret Space Captain who was framed because his friendship with Raptor Aliens makes him too dangerous to the New World Order.

It''s a classic esoteric performance by a drunk Alex, covering such diverse topics as "how Alex is a victim because of the lawsuits against him" and "how Alex is a victim because the listeners of his show don''t give him enough money." Definitely high end political talk.','3');

At the time, David was promoting the 7/7/07 Live Earth concerts and the book about climate change that he had written, but instead of really talking about any of that, Alex decides to be a huge dick and spout antisemitic conspiracy theories about his guest''s family.

In this episode, Dan tries to cover way too long a stretch of time, in order to get to the end of Alex''s 2015 Money Bomb, conveniently scheduled a few weeks before the end of the fiscal year. There''s a lot to cover, but thankfully Dan and Jordan have each other, and a guest appearance from their old friend, Red Wine, to help the medicine go down.','3');

But to accept the offer will mean giving up her place in her family to travel between the stars among strangers who do not share her ways or respect her customs.

In the news, Microsoft is offering an Edge VPN, Ukrainian drones are shockingly effective against the Russian Navy, and you should check your home to see if it has any of these strange old holes.Also don''t forget that the GeekNights Book Club is a thing!','2');

After the avatar of New York falls into a supernatural coma and vanishes, a group of five new avatars representing the five boroughs come together to fight their common Enemy.It''s the first book in her ongoing The Great Cities series, but it is self-contained and well worth reading alone.

A good OST has more than just a rockin'' opener or closer, it both enhances the show and stands alone. We cover some of the greatest, including Giant Robo, Initial D, Vision of Escaflowne, Revolutionary Girl Utena, Cowboy Bebop, and more.

It''s worth the price of admission even if you don''t know that it pulls a Frog Fractions. In the news, Rym beat Zelda II again for some reason, and Microsoft is acquiring Activision Blizzard for ~$70BB.

Most of you are probably too old to remember DLL Hell, but you probably don''t want to be proving how square roots are calculated just to calculate them in your program. In the news, Amazon has had multiple outages, the log4j zero-day is a nightmare, and VR is edging into the mainstream with its first real consumer maturity milestone.','2');

What should you buy for that animation, comics, anime, or manga fan friend of yours? Not Funkopops: they''ve released something that''s just vile in a long line of vile things. Arcane is one of the best cartoons Rym''s seen in a long time. Makoto Shinkai''s next film will be Suzume no Tojimari, and it involves clouds, sky, and doors. George Pérez is tragically at the end of his life. Macross Plus was in theaters, introducing a younger generation of fans to its particular dystopian nightmare.','2');

INSERT INTO episodes VALUES ('1037','GeekNights 20211111 - The Alien Franchise','Thu, 11 Nov 2021 22:00:00 -0500','Tonight on GeekNights, we consider the Alien franchise. While clearly the first two movies are the best the franchise will likely ever have to offer, much like Spiderman it is so iconic to be nearly universally recognized. In the news, Youtube is removing dislike counts, the economy isn''t in great shape (in ways you might not even realize), and the Playdate is delayed.','2');

The last time we talked about a WarioWare on GeekNights was back in 2007 when we reviewed the awful WarioWare Smooth Moves on the Wii. In the news, Konami lost the rights to some archival video they licensed, forcing them to take a number of Metal Gear Solid games down (contributing to the hellscape that is the intersection of copyright and gaming), and Unpacking is a pretty cool game.','2');

It''s free to play, not pay to win, and if you ignore the non-game-affecting skinz and lootz it''s definitely worth trying. In the news, the Advance Wars remaster is delayed, BlizzCon is canceled to be re-imagined, and you don''t need a rumble pack for your N64 Controller. Also, the OLED Switch doesn''t appear to be selling well, but that''s not actually a problem for Nintendo.','2');

We may need to consider that the concept of an Operating System has changed and continues to evolve as computer technology matures.

For this exercise, we only consider orthogames. We''ve talked about two player games before. The reality is that one player, two player, and three+ player games are fundamentally and formally distinct. A game that supports more than one of these groups is actually multiple different games for all practical purposes.In the news, NIBCARD Games wins the Diana Jones Award for Excellence in Gaming, the Diana Jones Award trophy is missing, the Actraiser remake is more than you probably expect, Metroid Dread is solid, and it''s hard to imagine PAX South happening in Texas in January considering the state has now banned vaccine mandates in a manner that very likely includes events in the convention center.','2');

INSERT INTO episodes VALUES ('1047','GeekNights 20211004 - Social Media','Mon, 04 Oct 2021 22:00:00 -0400','Tonight on GeekNights, we consider the Leopard that is social media. It is difficult to summarize the myriad ways that social media has materially harmed society despite its great promise. From Orkut to Facebook to Twitter, it''s been a destabilizing force. In the (possibly too on-the-nose) news, Facebook had a major global outage today (see our episode on outages), Facebook has a whistleblower revealing terrible revelations about the harm Facebook causes, a new tool can reveal who actually owns companies, and Europe is looking to (rightly) standardize on USB-C for charging electronic devices (much to Apple''s discomfort).','2');

INSERT INTO episodes VALUES ('1049','GeekNights 20210922 - Anime and Comic Magazines','Wed, 22 Sep 2021 22:00:00 -0400','Tonight on GeekNights, we consider anime and comic magazines, including relics from an ancient past such as Newtype USA, Wizard, Animerica, and the like. In the news, Rym is enjoying Star Trek: Lower Decks (and you may too if you have even a passing interest in Star Trek), the live action Cowboy Bebop might be OK, and the monkey''s paw has given us a hockey anime with Puraore! Pride of Orange.','2');
INSERT INTO episodes VALUES ('1050','GeekNights 20210920 - Computer Magazines','Mon, 20 Sep 2021 22:00:00 -0400','Tonight on GeekNights, we consider the archaic "computer magazine" that you may have heard old people talking about. From PC Gamer to Maximum PC to Computer Shopper, the pre-Internet was a wild time. In the news, Western Digital "My Book" users had all their data deleted in a convoluted story, Western Digital tried to trick people into buying inferior drives, Google''s internal dysfunction led briefly to Google News failing for all Google Workspaces users, and Sir Clive Sinclair has passed away at 81. Also Rym was nearly attacked by a crazy driver biking from Poughkeepsie to Queens on Sunday.','2');
INSERT INTO episodes VALUES ('1051','GeekNights 20210916 - Beverages','Thu, 16 Sep 2021 22:00:00 -0400','Tonight on GeekNights, we consider the humble beverage.

In the news, the IATSE is mobilizing for a possible strike, we encourage you to murder Spotted Lanternflies if you live in New York, and we encourage you to delete your Facebook account.','2');

It''s a solid legacy game that''s worth taking a look at. In the news, Rym finally played West of Loathing and is sorting out if we''ll play Aliens: Fireteam Elite, The CEO of Broken Token steps down (but still owns the company...) after abuse and harassment allegations, the CEO of Tripwire steps down due to his abhorrent statements on abortion rights, and Twitch sues two individuals over ongoing racist and bigoted harassment rampant on their platform.','2');

This character casts a long shadow on global popular culture and storytelling, a modern myth. In the news, the Harley Quinn show is great, Lupin III Part 6 has Mamoru Oshii as a guest writer, Adventure Time: Distant Lands concludes with Wizard City, Keiichi Arawi has a new manga coming, and (spoilers) Lex Luthor finally gets it.','2');

Ostensibly beginning with Doom and Quake, the "genre" began already extremely refined, and frankly Quake 1 Deathmatch is literally worth playing today. In the news, Rym biked to Poughkeepsie again, Quake 1 got an update that makes multiplayer "just work" on modern PCs, China effectively bans minors playing online games, and tabletop game prices are going to skyrocket.','2');
INSERT INTO episodes VALUES ('1056','GeekNights 20210823 - Apple, CSAM, and Privacy','Mon, 23 Aug 2021 22:00:00 -0400','Tonight on GeekNights, we consider Apple, CSAM, and Privacy. Apple is under fire for its solution here, some have warned of its dangers, and other companies already do similar things. (It''s worth noting that Apple is already doing this on iCloud Mail).In the news, OnlyFans sells out its core user base, though the situation is more complex than it appears and other similar entities have complied with the rules that they ran afoul of. Meanwhile, Twitch is doing essentially nothing to curtail a massive wave of targeted attacks on minority and marginalized streamers, leaving them to use inadequate tools to solve a problem that Twitch is 100% responsible for.

It''s a new tradition we''ve started on our Patreon feed: Every Friday, we''ll be bringing you a new bit of whimsy from the world of Alba Salix: bonus and deleted scenes, unrecorded scripts and games of various sorts. We''ll also post a few to our Alba Salix and Other Bothers podcast feeds, but Patreon patrons get to hear them all and hear them first! We are kicking things off with a recording from this past weekend in which the cast of The End of Time and Other Bothers sat down to play Larceny from Waning Gibbous Games. Larceny is a card game in the style of Apples To Apples or Cards Against Humanity, but one that lends itself very well indeed to improv and roleplaying. It''s themed around a heist, with the goal of stealing anything from diamonds to dinosaur DNA. With a pitch like that, how could we resist?
